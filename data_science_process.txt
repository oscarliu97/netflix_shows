Data science process:
                                            ####DATA SCIENCE####
1. What is the problem/objective of this project?(What do you want to answer? What is the scientific goal?)
    -Brainstorming ideas
    -Scientific methods/questions to formulate the objective

2. Form a hypothesis and determine the dataset needed(What sample size is needed? What data do we need to prove/reject the hypothesis?)
    -Form a intuitive answer(hypothesis)
    -Think of the dataset needed and what is the best methods to acquire the dataset.
    
                                           #### DATA ENGINEERING ####
3. Collect the dataset(How are the data sampled? Which data are relevant? Are there any privacy issues?)
    -Web Scraping/Download from API/ pay for it/ create yourself/ open-source data
                
                                           #### DATA ANALYSIS ####
4. Clean and organize the data(Is the data readable? Get rid of the unnecessary data. How to process the missing values? How to manage the outlier? 
    -Data wrangling(pandas,numpy,scipy,etc)
    -Tidy Data format
    -Think how to deal with the outlier and missing values
    
    
5. Explore the data(descriptive statistics & visualization) (Plot the data. Are there any anomaly? Are there any trend/pattern?
    -Summary statistics for numerical data
    -Data visualization(EDA) using plotly,matplotlib etc
    -Notice the trend/pattern/anomaly and make a statement of it
    -Probably can form a hypothesis to be tested by model as well
    
                                            ### MACHINE LEARNING ####
6. Build model to analyze data/predict data(Build a model. Fit a model. Validate a model)
    -Feature Selection and Feature Engineering(Which features are the best, how to transform them so that they can be used by model)
    -Which model is suitable? What is the pros and cons of different model? Select the best model
    -Fit a model, validate and improve the model
    
                                           #### DATA SCIENCE #####
7. Communicate the findings(What did we learn? Did the results make sense? Can we tell a story?)
    -What is the conclusion of this project/experiment/research?
    -What is the important findings?
    -What can be improved? What is the next steps?
    
                                            #### DATA SCIENCE #####
8. Ensure that your process and findings are reproducible.
